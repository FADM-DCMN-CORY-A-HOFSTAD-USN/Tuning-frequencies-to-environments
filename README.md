# Tuning-frequencies-to-environments
The ROONG gun can be tuned to the frequency of resonance for H2O molecules.

Install ROONG Equipment on military vehicles, vessels, and personnel.

The resonance of space molecules will carry the ROONG frequency into places of space which we need to make paths and safe places.

Any surveilance device which does not see well through water can be tuned to the frequency of water as a filter.
